# REFUSED(pinned-near-copy): reworded in place, the old wording quoted

The named paragraph was reworded where it stands, and its old wording
quoted at the end. The quote pairs with the pinned paragraph as `MOVED`,
and the reworded paragraph is an unmatched leaf with a similarity of at
least 0.5 to it. 0003 §8: the anchored leaf changed, and a near-copy of its
old wording unaccounted for, the transclusion refused.

SPEC.md §11.9:

> **Resolution**, against the target's current text:
>
> 0. The path must resolve, or `REFUSED(unresolvable-path)`. The target
>    document must exist, or `REFUSED(document-missing)`, and the
>    pinned blob must be readable, or `REFUSED(base-unavailable)`. Both the
>    pinned blob and the current target must pass the profile, or
>    `REFUSED(not-in-profile)`. The name must bind in the pinned blob, or
>    `REFUSED(record-inconsistent)`.
> 1. The name resolves as §8.1 says, against markers only. Zero matches, or
>    more than one, is `#REF!(name)`.
> 2. For each text-bearing leaf the name bound in the pinned blob, §11.3 and
>    §11.4 run with that blob as `base`. A refusal, or no pair, refuses the
>    transclusion, as `REFUSED(pinned-<reason>)`, where `<reason>` is §11.4's
>    reason or `orphaned`.
> 3. Each pair must lie inside what the name binds now. Otherwise the
>    transclusion is `REFUSED(name-rebound)`.
