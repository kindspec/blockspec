# EDITED: the anchored leaf edited away from its span

The paragraph's last clause changed, more than 32 code points after the
span's suffix. Its old and new text are the only leftovers in their gap and
are similar, so they pair as `EDITED`. The span, with its 31-code-point
prefix at the leaf's start and its 32-code-point suffix, has one hit, and
the alignment carries it there.

SPEC.md §11.3:

> 3. **Edits.** A base leaf `i` and a current leaf `j` left over in the same
>    gap pair as `EDITED` when all of these hold: their similarity is at least
>    0.5; it exceeds the similarity of `i` to every other leftover current
>    leaf in the gap by at least 0.15; and it exceeds the similarity of `j` to
>    every other leftover base leaf in the gap by at least 0.15.

SPEC.md §11.5:

> For `EDITED`, the span is searched **inside the paired leaf only**. A hit is
> an occurrence of `span` that meets both of these (0004, which amends 0003
> Q13):
>
> 1. **Its neighbours are unchanged.** The code point just before the
>    occurrence in the paired leaf's text compares equal to the code point
>    just before the span in `leaf.text`, and the code point just after it to
>    the one just after the span. U+0009, U+000A, U+000D and U+0020 compare
>    equal to one another; a text's start or end compares equal only to a
>    start or end; any other code point only to itself.
> 2. **Its context holds.** The prefix holds when the paired leaf's text
>    before the occurrence ends with `prefix`; when `prefix` is shorter than
>    32 code points, counted as stored, it must be all of that text (0003,
>    addendum, detail 6: a short context sits at the leaf's edge). The
>    suffix holds in the same way, after the occurrence and at the leaf's
>    end. Which sides must hold, and how they compare, depends on the types
>    of `leaf` and of the paired leaf:
>    - **either is `code` or `table`**: both sides, compared exactly, as
>      0003 Q13 decided, for a comment and a suggestion alike.
>    - **both are `p` or `h1` to `h6`**: each of the text before the occurrence, the
>      text after it, `prefix` and `suffix` is first written on its own with
>      every run of U+0009, U+000A, U+000D and U+0020 as one U+0020. **For a
>      comment**, one side must hold whose stored context is not empty; when
>      both are empty, the span is the whole leaf and both hold. **For a
>      suggestion**, both sides must hold.
