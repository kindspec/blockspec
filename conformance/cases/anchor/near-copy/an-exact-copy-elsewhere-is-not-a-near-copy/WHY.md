# RESOLVED: an unmatched copy outside the gap

`R` is unique in `base`, and the current text adds a second copy after the
last paragraph. `R` pairs as `EXACT` in its gap between `I` and `B`, where
both sides hold one copy, so the repeat rule passes. The new copy is
unmatched, but it is a copy, and the near-copy rule for `EXACT` takes only
an unmatched leaf that is not a copy of `k`. (Under 0003 the rule took a
similarity below 1, which excluded the same leaf.)

SPEC.md §11.4:

> - **`EXACT`**:
>   - if `base` or the current text holds more than one copy of `k`, the
>     number of copies in `k`'s gap must be equal on both sides, or
>     `REFUSED(repeat)`. The pair always lies in the gap: a repeated key is
>     never on the chain, so `k`'s `EXACT` pair comes from §11.3 step 2's
>     alignment inside `k`'s own gap (0003, second addendum of 2026-10-16,
>     item 9);
>   - an unmatched leaf that is not a copy of `k`, with word similarity to
>     `k` of at least 0.5: `REFUSED(near-copy)` (0004). When `k` has words,
>     a leaf that differs from it only in runs of U+0009, U+000A, U+000D and
>     U+0020 has word similarity 1 and is not a copy, so it refuses; when `k`
>     has none, no leaf reaches 0.5. Words leave out the type, so a heading
>     with `k`'s text at another level, or a paragraph, refuses.

SPEC.md §11.3:

> | §11 states | compare |
> | --- | --- |
> | similarity at least 0.5 | `4·L ≥ T` |
> | similarity below 1 | `2·L < T` |
> | `2·L₁/T₁` exceeds `2·L₂/T₂` by at least 0.15 | `40·L₁·T₂ − 40·L₂·T₁ ≥ 3·T₁·T₂` |
